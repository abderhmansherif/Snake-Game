# Snake-Game
 Snake Game developed with C# 
 
In this project, I created a simple Snake game in C#. I learned how to manage game mechanics like movement, collision detection, and fruit spawning using basic C# concepts such as lists, loops, and randomization. The game updates the snakeâ€™s position and handles user input with arrow keys while checking for collisions with walls and itself. Through this project, I gained experience in handling dynamic data, controlling game flow, and implementing basic real-time interaction in a console application.
